Who is it? 
----------

I'm a software developer. But I'm also a musician.  
I love creating beautiful pieces of code for audio purposes.  
And I love making music late at night.  
In the end, you could say I'm a music nerd trapped in the body of a software nerd.  

My professional resume is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romainclement) and [Viadeo](https://www.viadeo.com/fr/profile/romain.clement8).  
My personal projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rclement).  
Some pieces of music are on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/rclement).
